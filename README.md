## About

  This project is an business management application that allows a user to interact with a mysql database that includes departments, roles and employees that exist in the company. The application is built using ```Nodejs```, ```Inquirer```, ```console.table``` and ```mysql```.

  
---
## Usage
  
  Install the applicaiton dependancies using the above command, initialize the database in mysql by running mysql -u <user> -p <password>. Then, source db/schema.sql followed by source db/seeds.sql. Now that the database is initialized, run npm start to run the CLI application and interacti with it as you wish.

  When a user starts the application, they are presented with a series of prompts, randing from view database information to changing or deleting information.

  ![Seeds]()

  After selecting a prompt, the application will handle the user request by querying the database and returning the data in a ```console.table``` command for easy reading. An example output is below:

  ![Seeds]()

  After the output is returned, the application will provide the user with another opportunity to select a new way to interact with the database - the same way that the user is prompted when the application is first started.

When the user is done with the applications, they can exit using the command control + c.

All of the base acceptance criteia has been met, along with 5 bonus criteria: Budget per department, delete department, delete role, delete employee, view employees by department.
